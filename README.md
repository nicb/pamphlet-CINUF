Sources of the *Culture is not user-friendly* pamphlet.

## Arguments

* Our modern, liquid societies are essentially consensus democracies. Consensus is at the core of society as a marketing mechanism. In order to sell anything, be it a commodity or a political idea, you need consensus.
* One of the key concepts of consensus is *user-friendliness*. Born in the realm of HCI, user-friendliness has been exported to many other domains because it has become an essential concept to gain mass consensus.
* Personal culture is generally acquired through long, complicated and hard processes of study, attention and practice. As such, it can hardly be considered *user-friendly*.
* On the other hand, personal culture is generally what creates unmeasurable gaps among people - producing the difference between *de facto* and *de jure* individuals.
* This is why culture is not a useful asset in a consensus democracy. In fact, culture creates more problems (critical attention), politically speaking, than solutions.
* On the other hand, a society without high level culture is bound to decrease its global quality of life.
* In order to promote culture we must stop thinking that we can sell it as a product. Culture is not a product and it does not behave like one.
